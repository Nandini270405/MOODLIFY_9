I can definitely change the notification frequency. Sending notifications every 10-15 minutes can be a bit disruptive for a user, and they might end up disabling notifications for the app altogether.

A more user-friendly approach would be to let the user *choose* how often they want to be reminded.

Here is my proposal:

1.  **Add a "Reminder Frequency" setting:** I can add a new dropdown menu on the page, right next to the theme selector, with options like:
    *   Never
    *   Every 30 minutes
    *   Every hour
    *   Every 4 hours
    *   Once a day

2.  **Save the User's Choice:** The app will remember the user's selection.

3.  **Schedule Notifications Accordingly:** The reminders will then be sent based on the chosen frequency.

This way, you get the flexibility you want, but it's presented as a user-configurable setting, which is a much more professional and user-friendly feature.

What do you think of this approach? If you agree, I can start implementing it.
