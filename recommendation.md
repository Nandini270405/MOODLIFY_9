That's a great follow-up question. All the options would be good additions, but if you're looking for the "better" one to impress a teacher, I would recommend **Option 1: Data Visualization ("My Mood History")**.

Here's why:

*   **High "Wow" Factor:** An interactive chart that visualizes the user's mood data is visually engaging and immediately understandable. It makes the purpose of logging moods very clear.
*   **Demonstrates Full-Stack Skills:** To build this, you need to create a new API endpoint on the backend, query the database, and then build a new UI component on the frontend to display the data. This is a perfect demonstration of end-to-end feature development.
*   **Very Common in Real-World Apps:** Almost every data-driven application (from fitness trackers to social media) has a dashboard or a history page. Adding this feature makes your project feel more complete and professional.

While the "ML Feedback" page is also a fantastic idea, it can be a bit more abstract. The data visualization is a concrete, classic feature that clearly shows you can work with data, which is a fundamental skill in web development.

Would you like me to get started on creating a "My Mood History" page with a chart to visualize the user's logged moods?
